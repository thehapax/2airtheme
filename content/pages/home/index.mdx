### Our data is crowdsourced, help make it better! 
There is no solid source of data on the internet for financial crimes, 
it is often locked behind paywalls, or in non-searchable formats like PDFs
or just plain forgotten about. We are powered by you as all our information 
can be submitted by anyone via the form below and it will be added to the main 
sheet once verified. Thanks!
